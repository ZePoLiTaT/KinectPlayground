This project converts point clouds and meshes between VTK formats and PCL formats.

Point Clouds
------------
vtkPolyData <-> pcl::PointCloud

Meshes
------
vtkPolyData <-> pcl::PolygonMesh

The conversions are provided in PCLtoVTK.h/cpp and VTKtoPCL.h/cpp.

Drivers are provided to demonstrate the conversions. The files are named PCD instead of PCL and VTP
instead of VTK because these are the specific file types we are reading and writing in the examples.
